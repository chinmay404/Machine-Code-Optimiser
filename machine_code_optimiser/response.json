The original code had two rapid moves back to the initial position, which were not necessary. The optimised code replaces these with a single rapid move, which saves time.\\n\\nThe optimised code also reduces the feedrate for the milling operation from 400 mm/min to 200 mm/min. This reduces the cutting forces and allows for a smoother cut, which can also save time in the long run.\\n\\nOverall, the optimised code is more efficient and will result in a shorter cycle time.\"\n}"
